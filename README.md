# Alzheimer_detection_CSA
In this project i wanted to create a tool to detect early stage of Alzheimer disease based on brain MRI extracted from ADNI database. I used a kaggle dataset


The objective of our work is to improve machine learning based recognition by a method inspired by nature. We will implement the Crow-search algorithm based on the paper of the authors (S.Labaadi et al.,2019 [1]).


This notebook aim to make use of the kaggle dataset to classificate alzheimer disease devlopment.

It is supported by two repositories that I found on the internet :

https://github.com/ShaileshDhama/Alzheimer-Detection-and-Classification/blob/master/alzheimer-detection-and-classification.ipynb
https://www.kaggle.com/borellirajaswanik/alzheimer-s-disease-classification-notebook

Please note that if you want to reproduce my results you have to download this dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images
