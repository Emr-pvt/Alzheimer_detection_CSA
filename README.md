# Alzheimer_detection_CSA
In this project i wanted to create a tool to detect early stage of Alzheimer disease based on brain MRI extracted from ADNI database. I used a kaggle dataset


The objective of our work is to improve machine learning based recognition by a method inspired by nature. We will implement the Crow-search algorithm based on the paper of the authors (Hussein et al.,2015 [6]).


This notebook aim to make use of the kaggle dataset to classificate alzheimer disease devlopment.

It is supported by two repositories that I found on the internet :
